Traditional pairs trading strategies rely on strict assumptions about the relationships between securities, namely that there exists a linear relationship between candidate securities. By utilizing measurements from information theory, securities are tested for the existence of polynomial relationships. Pairs with strong relationships are chosen and dollar neutral portfolios are traded. The portfolio of portfolios is found to outperform the S&P 500 index in both in-sample and out-of-sample backtests, in terms of absolute performance, Sharpe ratio, and relative drawdown.

This research relaxes the assumption of linear relationships between securities and utilizes the mutual information between candidate securities to test securities for polynomial relationships. The mutual information of two random variables measures the mutual dependence between two variables and is often used as a generalized version of correlation. Securities with high mutual information indicate the existence of either a linear or nonlinear relationship which can be utilized to generate a dollar neutral portfolio.
